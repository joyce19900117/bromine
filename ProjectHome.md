<h1>Welcome to Bromine</h1>
<h2>Let it test your entire iPhone application</h2>

Bromine lets you create automated interface tests for your iPhone SDK application.<br>
<br>
It maps your entire application to XML structures so you can access your views via xpath and verify values, scroll tables, simulate touches, edit text and more.<br>
<br>
This project was inspired by Matt Gallagher's article (<a href='http://cocoawithlove.com/2008/11/automated-user-interface-testing-on.html'>Cocoa with Love: Automated user interface testing on the iPhone</a>) which brings, among others, the base technique for this project: simulate touch.<br>
<br>
Selenium (<a href='http://selenium.seleniumhq.org/'>http://selenium.seleniumhq.org/</a>) is another inspiration, since it has the same objective for web applications. Some Bromine commands will be very similar to Selenium ones. By the way, Bromine(35) follows Selenium(34) in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table'>Periodic Table of Elements</a>.<br>
